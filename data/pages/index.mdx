    And all not user-related data is going to be <mark>transparent and open sourced.</mark>

<span className="subtitle">

The philosophy is that giving before asking is the right thing to do.

We believe that a client that trusts you for the first time is giving you a leap of faith.

So we are going to share everything to add value where we can before.
