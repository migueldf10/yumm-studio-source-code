# Yumm Studio is a full stack marketing agency.
<span className="subtitle">
    And from week 0 all not user-related data is *transparent* and open source. 
</span>

</HeroSection>

## Why?

<span className="subtitle">

The philosophy is that giving before asking is the right thing to do.

We believe that a client that trusts you for the first time is giving you a leap of faith.

So we are going to share everything to add value before. And if you need a tailormade growth plan, or have a chat about it, <Link to='/hire-yumm'>work with us</Link>
