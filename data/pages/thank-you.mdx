To great people, that gave away things without whose I wouldn’t be able to create this page.

To the entire Gatsby development team, an open source project that is revolutionizing web technology, specially Kyle Mathews who tirelessly helps almost every single question I had (posted mostly by others) about scaling Gatsby projects.

To the L program, who taught me how to create sustainable business plans by setting strong values, such as giving before receiving, define the game rules beforehand and some more, in the total quality program while I was part of their L program for a year, for free.

To Buffer, because their entire transparency program gave me the idea and the strong perception that a transparent way of creating companies was possible, and although doesn’t mean you can’t fail, at least you will do it showing how to not do it.
