# Work with Yumm Studio

</HeroSection>

First, hi!

My name is Miguel, and 

## I help companies to develop and execute effective online marketing plans.

I've been doing this for more than 4 years now and lately I founded a new concept mainly because I think is very fun.

In case you have been following Yumm you already are familiarized about which kind of job I make, which tools I use and how I believe things should be done.

But in case you are new to it, this project is called Yumm Studio, this page, where I share and discuss all the internal processes, ideas and conclusions with the public (only keeping secret all client related things for obvious reasons)




In case you want, I usually do onboarding talks and calls a couple of times a day, <a href="https://linkedin.com/ln/migueldf10"> might we connect on linkedIn and have a chat?</a>
