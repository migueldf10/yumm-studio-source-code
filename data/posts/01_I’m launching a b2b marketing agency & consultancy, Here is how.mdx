Lately I moved to the Netherlands and I started to adapt my online marketing agency to this new scenario! So I am rebuilding everything to get a more effective adquisition system, with more automated cloud based solutions. 

And the good news is that **everything will be shared with open source license** ! A little bit about the principles behind the Yumm Studio rebuilding.

### Transparency in everything

You will be able to follow every step of the process, roadmaps and data numbers of every iteration of the process. Strip out all the data. Share & show everything.

I found difficult to find projects that share marketing efforts, strategies and results. And that would be super useful to learn about some concepts. So here I think I should do it and I will!

All client data and conversations will be hidden by default, because of obvious reasons.

### Open by default.

We work everyday with different technologies to do testing, fast development and automate elements via Apis and database population & Analytics. It was a hard path to walk to learn them, because all the great content online tends to be isolated from all the other parts, so getting the overview was difficult if not impossible.

I think sharing everything in creative commons will inspire others to do the same, and also help the community to focus in their strategies more than in the tech behind.

Strategies will be shared and planned public, also results, technical information and conclusions!

### Agile development.

We are treating the website, the marketing and all the automation tools as products under development. 

Everything will be developed in weekly sprints, with a backlog and incremental improvements. (in case you don't know aboutthey are are, <a className="black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">here you can learn about Agile product development </a>)
