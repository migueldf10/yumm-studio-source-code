# I’m launching a b2b marketing agency & consultancy. Here is how.

## The principles.

Transparency in everything. You will be able to follow every step of the process, roadmaps and data numbers of every iteration of the process.
Strip out all the data. Share & show everything.
Promises:

-   Open - Everyone will be able to learn and participate in all the own corporate info and tools. (All client data and conversations will be hidden by default)
-   Strategies will be shared and planned public, also results, technical information and conclusions!
-   The roadmap: First , MVP with minimal functionalities and all data tracking and event & goal analysis for further development and testing.

## How things are going to be shared.

    - Design - Design system using public figma files
    - Brand design, all illustrator brand guidelines and definitions.
    - Front end development. All technological and code lines will be shared on github.
    - Finances. Check our financial console on google sheets

## Business Roadmap.

MVP creation.
First market tests and first rounds of feedback
Identify potential pitfalls, identify potential growth vectors.
Reach the critical mass -> Objective, one growth test per week.

## Finances.

Monthly goals and KPIs.
Setting the KPIs
Initial costs and expected units.

## Marketing & Growth

The interesting part.
What is our NorthStar metric, which are our tracked KPIs , what drives our growth.
The road to the critical mass. I believe there is a big empty hole in what holistic marketing strategies are and how they are implemented.
It’s a process, and a full timeline is a really valuable asset that today, is missing. With this project my main goal is to show that. And test the show itself to share important information to everyone.
KPIs, goals and analysis of metrics.
Tools -> Utm tables
Event tracking ( Categories and actions )

## Tech stack.

The Jamstack. Have you heard of it? Is simply amazing and I would like to share some great articles talking about it.
The requirements.
Has to allow a lot of customization, integration and testing.

Is open source! And you can see everything we are doing in the internal wiring of our tech stack in this schema and diagrams of processes and automations.

A small foot note on this post. If you need to set up or reset your tech stack, it might be you want some help, maybe we can connect on linkedIn or you can send me an email so we can talk about it! Or you can fill in the form, if you are one of those ;)

## Deepening in the data model.

Each post will have:

-   Title
-   Seo Title, Description, slug
-   Join the discussion.
-   Embeddable (Airtable, Pinterest, Trello, Google Sheets...) Block
-   Follow the thread (internal link)
-   Notes?

## Design.

Stylescape of the brand (brought straight from the futur)
Website behaviors and style.
Website functions to accomplish.

## Business inteligence.
