# Tech Stack, an overall approach

Well, here we have the project every creative worker fears the most. Choices for yourself.

Choosing the tech stack means choosing not for today, but for the future. We need to be able to produce a system that grows with us, but doesn’t slow us a bit, since the early days are the easiest failure moment ever.

After some time in business , I came with a few key points that in my experience define the path and the approach very much. These points are such as: 

## The team behind, have a tech background or there are key roles behind with tech experience? 

Let’s say you are in an ecommerce business, and you want to create a shop. Let’s put it this way. Amazon performs better than any managed solution, but you can’t create amazon. So solutions like Shopify or Bigcommerce are huge advantages vs a self managed creation.

~If you have tech roles or tech bg, you can opt for a mixed solution, like shopify for CMS + Checkout tech but use a thing like gatsby to be faster than competition~

## Do you have a 5 years old plan?

## Our detailed experience. How things affected our choice.

Well this is a list of requirements we had.

- Powerful blogging platform. This means, content flexibility, powerful SEO control
- Tech role behind 
- Strong testing and functionality implementation, regarding new tools and strategies ~(after all this blog is also a laboratory of new ideas for me and for you, since everything is transparent and everyone can learn and suggest here)~
- Modern for now and the next 5 years. Let’s say you are in a competitive work and you sell through SEO. If your platform is slow and there is a fast platform, your competitors will have a stronger position than you. No matter what you do, your tech will ruin your business unless you react fast. I want to be fast in tech pivoting. 

	> ~It’s exactly whats going on with static site generators, they are the new kid on the block, faster, more flexible, cheaper, and will eventually eat all last century content managers, like Wordpress.~

- Reduce the amount of dependencies in third parties. I hate to work in hard wired retaining platforms. If I can choose, I prefer to keep the option alive of exporting my data and importing it in a new tool.
- Scalable cost structure. I don’t want to test with thousand of euros in tools until I do not get thousands of euros in return.

## Our winner.

If you are in the tech world, you already know who is the winner in every single aspect of the options. If not I tell you.

### We choose a Static Site Generator (SSG) in our case, Gatsby.

Upsides:
The biggest single option. Your data is yours, and it’s completely not wired to the tech, so you can choose your CMS, your analytics, do your test, and especially, migrate it to wherever you want.

It uses React, the fastest growing front end technology and the 2nd more popular already, developers are ready to work.
It’s blazing fast, faster than everything else, because since it’s static, servers just server and doesn’t rely on caches or operations to gather data.

You have full control over every aspect, you can hack it and it’s open source. I

That is why static site generators are an extreme revolution, at least till all the fallen behind switch drastically changes.
Downsides:

- You have to know to develop in react, you can approach a Gatsby project from a beginners mind, but to be serious and competitive also in time, you need to have a relatively  high development profile.
- You can be really wrong. like in any other field, the more open the platform, the you can personalize , the more you can mess things while trying to improve them. 

So the conclusion is , if you are a beginner, go for a standard solution, and learn where you wish you could improve, before attempting to go to a personalized solution. 

If you have a track of records and you already crashed with your standard solution’s borders and competitive disadvantages, maybe is time to step up your game! ~(In case you want to give it a talk, I like to help in this subject, reach out to me here!)~
(Let’s say you want to create a shop, if you use shopify + a predefined theme you will be completely standard, for the bad, your brand will be encapsulated and for the good. You won’t be able to mess hard and create a not usable checkout process.
So as you may noticed, there is not a single solution and not a unique way of solve this concept, but considering all options, it’s better to anticipate to be in a right place in a right moment.
