## What is a brand?

An entity that collects all the value you add and receive to/from the world. So it has to be recognisable, distinguisable, memorable and a little bit more.

### What does it mean if it's an emerging online brand.

All the attributes said before mean nothing, if it doesnt make remember your web addres / social profile / etc. So let's forget about the big words of logo design and create something people will be able to remember to type your web address ( take into account that you are the smallest fish in the sea, so if they type the niche you work in, you will be likely behind your big competitors you want to avoid.

Nike evolution if it would be an emerging online newbie.

## Form VS Function

Although there are examples of designers who clearly understand the concept, is common specially in seasoned pros to don't understand how important is the function of design in the online world. Style is great, but if it doesn't function well, the marketing team will kill you or even worse, they will start designing extremely horrible landing pages with higher conversion rates, and you will kill them, and be fired.

I believe, there is an internal fight between great design and The middle point. Be memorable and beatiful, remind to your main functional purpose. RETAIN.

# The job, definition and phases.

After this alignment intro, let's go with the content.

The inmediate goal is to create a minimal design to accomplish the phase 1 or as I call it Yumm-v1.0 which you can see in it's entire actions frame here (LINK) to the sprint 01 phase.

Before we see the ecosystem, the competition, and what the great guys are around, are doing. Always keeping the distance, the more unique it is, the more risky might be, so...

> we will be unique in some parts, and effective in others.

## Design preparation, curated references and overall mood. The Stylescape.

At this stage, before puting ourselves inside design it's great to make an intense research out there to gather curated content you find interesting to be inspired by to create your brand. (shotout to thefutur, who introduced the concept to me, link at the footer)

1- Color/colors amount and tones
2- Typhography hierachry and scale
3- Navigation and information distribution styles
4- Animation styles
5- Copy tone and connection with the customer tones.

Ours is a very simple collection I have found mainly visiting the more inspiring creators and companies I admire, not only because they are in the trend and style, but because they are in the effectiveness side of design.

## Brand design, the creation process step by step.

As a growth agency with full stack focus, we think that the beauty is the integration between different parts of the company. You can't separate logo design from UX/UI or animations, but most importantly, you cant separate graphic design from marketing performance and technical capabilities and device or social devices usage cases.

Such thing you can see in the amazing redesign of AirBnb taken by DesignStudio, where whithout the Airbnb product team close connection with the design team, nothing would have been possible.

So all is seen as a whole in the early steps, developed in close connecion and shown all together at the end to make an overall look.

Idealistically, all should be designed with the entire team working together.

So before getting to dreamy, let's focus. The first design (V1.1) should be a proposition to get an identity to launch and evolve fast from the first contact with the market (you ;)

### Logo design and usage variations.

Simple, with all the functional requirementes of being the same as the domain name, the first KPI we will track to check the user retention, we should try to make every visitor engaged with our content, but we should also imprint in them the name of this new brand, so they recognise us in social and future impacts!
(Did it work? let us know in the comments below)

### UI/UX design process.

### Social design. Tools and vectors to test in the marketing sprints.

From the idea to the final version, we work basically using Adobe Ilustrator. you can download our logo by leaving your mail here.

From wireframing to

In my design career I have to say I always thought, why do I have to care about mono color representation of the logo, if it's a website and no one will print anything
The fact is that luckylly I followed the use standard test, do logos adaptable to all platforms, so they have a use case for mono color representation, low res and small print.

## Website design.

Here is where we spend most of the time. As you might have done if you are an enterpreneur with no time to design, once you have a logo, you stick it into a template and change the font and primary color of the template, and voilaaa!

Not that fast,

Although there is no big downside on doing this, you are missing an oportunity.

If your site is memorable and effective you will achieve the holy grail of website building. Increase retention, increase conversions. And that my friend, it's worth every effort in most of the cases.

So let's focus in design principles before building the basic design system for V1.0

## Let's critic the results.

I would really appreciate some help, critics and comments on this content. Since this is a transparent company in it's first iterations, every comment is a growint oportunity to evolve and learn, and I want to grow.

Byeeee
