    In a fast response, is the way of introducing changes in a website and read how well they perform, so you can keep them, work further on them or step back. Before messing things up or without rolling all the changes to every user, so you do your tests with a controlled public, instead of everyone.

# Why doing testing

It is a way to don’t be blind while implementing changes, understanding the behavior of your users and step by step , improve the performance of your site.
Top performing websites are the result of multiple incremental changes, where things were changed step by step, learning in every iteration. Examples of this incremental optimization are done in every major website since it was introduced the button creation in Amazon.com 30 years ago.
One thing it happens is that is common to read about testing, but is actually hard to see tests and how they are doing, so we, as a transparent company specialized in online marketing thought it would be helpful to share transparently everything involved in this test. You can see all here! ~LINK~

# What can you test?

Depending on the size and tech stack you are using, some tests might be difficult, but there is a way to test everything.
The most efficient and less time consuming tests are for example,

-   Test button colors and sizes to maximize CTR.
-   Landing page copys to maximize Conversion Rate.
-   Include / exclude navigation in pages to balance Conversion and see if it sinks the bounce rate.
-   Include / exclude user reviews in product pages to see if they increase conversions.
-   Add a notification with scarcity to check if the FOMO works along or against your conversions.
    Some things particularly hard to test.
    All SEO Stuff.
    Since it depends on the SEO crawl and algorithm your positioning and ranking, you won’t be able to test the same content with two variations without creating duplicates. Something you shouldn’t do in case you didn’t know. You can only test in different timespans, but in this case, you the timespan will be defined by the Search Engine, not by you.
    The actual way is to update part of your pages and track. The differences in performance between the two groups. (Something I consider necessary, but not extremely elegant)

# What do you need to do testing,

In between all the platforms online, you can test in any of them, the bases are.

-   Define your goal and expected results, track them accurately and try to store all the data.
-   Keep a backlog, where you and your team can learn from the differences between the expected, the result and the conclusions. Also in the future.
-   Define the exact difference you need to consider the experiment clear. (It’s a common trap to stop test too early to have a statistically significant result because it seems significant) Data analysts, comment!!
-   Define the limits of the test. Sometimes timespan, sometimes amount of visitors, sometimes statistic signifcancy reached.

## Can I do that in my website?

Sure! There are many ways of performing AB tests in your site, a tiny list picking the main ones.

-   Tools to do & analyze. For example, the free and powerful Google Optimize. It is connected with your G analytics KPIs and is easy to set up. Virtually works in every kind of website that can let you insert JS code in headers. You can test everything you can do using Js or CSS
-   Plugins in systems, such as (ABTESTING in shopify, mmmTest in Wordpress ...) The only limitation is that depending on your website, you will need a little bit of configuration to test specific complex parts more than the CSS modifications they usually do. ::(Include Reviews of the most popular ones)::
-   Creating different versions of the site and link it to analyze tools. For example, creating a smart website with two variations and using the tool you want to track results. (This is the one we use in our site, since our tech stack is 100% thought about marketing performance) it is only possible in a reduced amount of sites, only in the modern stack ones such as React Based sites or fully custom developed solutions. (If you want one contact us ;) Or your own apps (you need a development team)
-   Integral tools. Such as optimizely and ... This tools create pages in blocks with small changes and perform all the tests and tech stack for you. The problem, they are not website builders, they are landing page builders, so depending on your field, you will need more than one server/host. One for landing pages and optimize them and one for your main site.
-   Channel testing. This is the simplest and more used version of testing. You create two ads, with the same conversion goal and direct them to different version of your page. So you can test which one performs best from the ad panel. No need to mess with your server or tracking the experiment data.

# Different kind of tests.

Site wide tests

# How the tests are done here.

As a sum up, we are a marketing agency, that started working independently on first of January 2020, we are in the early stage of a website, were tests are bold, significant and altough our volume is low, we aim for improving at least 50% in the main KPI, per test.
We only have the size to care about tests that last between two weeks till one month (as you probably have seen in our KPIs, our volume is small, so to have a definite result of test, we need the tests to last more than I would like)
In case you don’t know we are fully transparent business, where all our code is open source, our internal processes, designs and results are shared publicly and our metrics and conclusions are open to everyone to think along with us and learn from the entire process.
You can see our tests, how we perform them, week by week, what are we testing, why are we testing and ~a completely transparent backlog of every step in this link~!
