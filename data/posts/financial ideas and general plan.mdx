# Financial ideas. The things behind the curtain are now in front of everyone. When to monetize, when to invest, when to test beta and when to growth, crazily.

First, let’s talk about financial models on startups. The idea is usually to gain growth by loosing money until you reach critical mass. Then you exit and a stablished company makes money out of it.
You don’t fail if you don’t spend.
Our only costs are monthly tools and salaries. Everything is compiled in our simple financial plan month to month.

## Tools we use.

-   Mailchimp (communication),
-   Airtable (CRM),
-   Airtable (DB),
-   Airtable
-   Zapier, (business Logic),
-   Calendly, GSuite (communication + Schedule)
-   Github + Netlify + G Analytics + G Optimize, (Website)

You will see that most of these tools offer an extensive free tier and offer a scale up system that will grow while we grow. A thing that I simply love, and create a strong powerful position to grow from.
The way the salaries will be paid is simple. Now the team is only one person. Me ! And I’m also the founder, so my time will be counted as money I invest in.

Where can this fail?

Is a question we see in many investors. Be ready, advance the critical point, the weakest spot in the plan.

### GROWTH

If you don’t manage to gather customers in a cost that permits sustainable investment from profits fast enough, it will require a bunch of money without stick into the market.

## Gain traction by paid growth and then monetize vs be able to monetize and then grow.

I’m simply a fan of the second option. Maybe it has to do with the year I spent in a business shool / business accelerator, where I could see many projects and startups financial structures, advise they received and results.
The idea that I like the most is, you don’t know how good you can perform growth wise, so we are creating a minimal beta with the required features to:

## Short term financials.

Invest to create an MVP and launch it to market.

-   Show engaging content
-   Measure content performance
-   Retain and increase brand value and perception
-   First test of a easy conversion. Optimize and vary to get here before of 10k.

In here we will stay, with a max investment of 10k €, to see if the sustainability happens, tweaking, or start a growth and expansion phase.
So, we will come to a mixed approach, we are setting an objective KPIS and go towards there to unblock next phase.
We will see how it goes in the following weeks. You can keep up to date by leaving your mail address (we send a weekly brief letter with a compilation of articles) > Es imposible ganar sin jugar ni jugar sin arriesgarse.
